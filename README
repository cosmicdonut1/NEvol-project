Real-Time EEG Processing and Motor Imagery Control System

## Project Description

This project involves real-time processing of EEG signals for controlling a simulated wheelchair in Blender using motor imagery. The system reads brainwaves in real-time using OpenBCI and Unicorn BCIs, filters the signals, and employs a neural network to predict motor imagery movements of the hands. The predicted movements are then used to control the simulated wheelchair.

Terminology:
batch - Locally stored signals (of a certain duration)
chunk - Streaming signals from device (but accumulated as a chunk of particular size)
stream - Real-time stream of signals (at a sample level)

## Content

- **Real-time EEG Signal Processing**: The project includes real-time reading of EEG signals using OpenBCI and Unicorn BCIs.
- **Filters**: The raw EEG data is processed using band-pass and notch filters to remove noise and extract relevant signal components.
- **ML**: A neural network is trained and utilized for predicting motor imagery movements (e.g., hand movements) from the EEG signals.
- **Control System**: The neural network's predictions are used to control a simulation of a wheelchair in Blender in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenBCI and Unicorn BCIs libraries (+MNE)
- Blender for simulation
- Necessary machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Real-time data processing libraries
